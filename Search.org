Once you are familiar with the basics, [[id:a3e5b65f-b27c-460a-9cc0-e2b01de8b917][basic commands]] and [[id:117becf4-f5e7-4c91-8919-59d91b74a4e1][link concepts]], it is time to learn about search.

You can use the standard search for a *tag* with =M-x org-tags-view=

You can search for text using =M-x org-search-view=.

From either of these results pages, you can use =C-c l= to store links, which you can then add to a document using =C-c C-l=. You can store multiple links, and you can insert all stored links using =C-c C-M-l=. 

You can also search for test using =M-x org-occur-in-agenda-files=. This will be faster than =org-search-view= but you cannot easily extract links from it in the same way.
