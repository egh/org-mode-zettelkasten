:END:

Starting from pure =org-mode=, a Zettelkasten system needs:
 - links between notes that are easy to make and easy to follow
 - a system for =tags= and a way to generate an index
 - decent search

The system should be enhanceable using small code blocks  out of the box org mode extensions (e.g. =org-ql=)

Importantly, the Zettelkasten should
 - be human readable
 - prevent lock-in
