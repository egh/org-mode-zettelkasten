I am a long time Org mode user who was curious about the Zettelkasten system. There seemed to be a lot of good systems out there, but I was interested in something that conformed as closely as possible to the Org mode idioms and expectations that I was used to.

When I found the [[https://github.com/EFLS/zd-tutorial][Zetteldeft tutorial]], it seemed the perfect thing to adapt to what I already knew about Org mode, to see if that was possible.
