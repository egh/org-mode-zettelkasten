Welcome to Zettelorg. Zettelorg allows you to create a set of interlinked notes, thus implementing a Zettelkasten like system.

You are now reading the Zettelorg tutorial.

If don't already have Zettelorg installed, please take a look at the [[id:b9c8bf44-3980-4026-8737-cc546a166d31][START HERE]] file first.

The one keybinding you need to know to get started, is =C-c C-o= (or =org-open-at-point=), to select links to follow.

With this knowledge, you are ready to read on.
