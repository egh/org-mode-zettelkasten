* Backlinks

Because all links are kept in plain text, it can be useful to search for all notes that link to the current note. You can use =org-occur-link-in-agenda-files= to search for backlinks to the current node.

Unfortunately, out of the box this requires that the link description exactly match the title of the node. Here is an alternative solution that searchs for any backlink, no matter the description.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(defun zorg-backlinks ()
  "Search for backlinks to current entry."
  (interactive)
  (let ((link (condition-case nil
		  (org-id-store-link)
		(error "Unable to create a link to here"))))
    (org-occur-in-agenda-files (regexp-quote link))))
#+end_src

If you use [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]] you might prefer this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(defun zorg-backlinks ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((link (condition-case nil
		  (org-id-store-link)
	       (error "Unable to create a link to here")))
             ;; (org-entry-get (point) "ID"))
         (query `(link :target ,link)))
    (org-ql-search
      org-agenda-text-search-extra-files
      query
      :title (concat "Links to: " (org-get-heading t t)))))
#+end_src
