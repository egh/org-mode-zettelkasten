To get started with Zettelorg, lets take a look at some basic commands.

Create and edit new files in your zd-tutorial directory as you usually would. You can use org modes outlining features. To directly *open* one of the notes in your Zettelkasten, open a file as expected.

You can *create* a new note file with =C-x C-f= (=find-file=), or use =C-<return>= or =M-<return>= to create new headings in an existing file. If you want to set up a capture template to make this easier, you can and should.

Tag entries using the usual org way, =C-c C-c= in a headline.
