* Exporting with org-publish
Exporting notes is one way to conveniently read them outside of Emacs. Org mode provides functions to conveniently export notes.

Exporting relies on Org mode and the =org-publish= functions. This configuration will publish to a =docs/= subdirectory in this project as HTML

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(add-to-list
 'org-publish-project-alist
 `("org-mode-zettelkasten-tutorial"
   :base-directory ,default-directory
   :publishing-directory ,(expand-file-name "docs" default-directory)
   ;; publishing configuration
   :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
   ;; org config
   :headline-levels 4
   :with-toc nil
   :with-date nil
   :with-author nil
   :html-head-extra "<link rel='stylesheet' href='static/style.css' type='text/css'/>\n"
   :html-head-extra nil
   ))
#+end_src

Some pointers for people unfamiliar with Org-publish:
 - =:publishing-directory= should be where you want your final notes to go
 - =:html-head-extra= can be used to include styling

The Org exporting features will try to resolve all Org style links and halt if deems one is broken.
To still be able to export, it is a good idea to set =org-export-with-broken-links= to =t=.
